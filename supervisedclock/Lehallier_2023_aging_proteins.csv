"ST1. Aging Proteins with corresponding identifiers, the amount of studies they were identified in and corresponding age coefficients across the different studies and an identifier if they are up- or downregulated during aging. Estimated age coefficients are provided for each protein, for the corresponding study in which they were significantly associated with age. Protein classes summarizing several proporties of the APs such cellular compartments and functions are retrieved from The Human Protein Atlas (www.proteinatlas.org).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
